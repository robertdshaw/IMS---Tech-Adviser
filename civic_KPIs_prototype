    ### Simplified Calculation Method
    
    Each category performance score (0-100%) represents effectiveness, not volume:
    
    **Educate Performance = Average of:**
    - Completion rate (did they finish reading?)
    - Time on page (did they engage deeply?)
    - Comprehension (did they understand?)
    
    **Perspective Performance = Average of:**
    - Source diversity (how many different voices?)
    - Geographic spread (local vs national sources?)
    - Viewpoint balance (multiple perspectives?)
    
    **Help Performance = Average of:**
    - CTA click rate (did they click action buttons?)
    - Resource downloads (did they use tools?)
    - Follow-through (did they actually act?)
    
    **Update Performance = Average of:**
    - Reach (how many people informed?)
    - Speed (how quickly published?)
    - Accuracy (corrections needed?)
    
    **Inspire Performance = Average of:**
    - Share rate (did they spread the story?)
    - Positive sentiment (were they moved?)
    - Behavior change (did they act?)
    
    ### Public Interest Score

    Score = Œ£(Performance √ó Weight) for all categories
